1. Template bootstrap
2. Create html pages
3. Nav Bar: Add links
4. Copy neccesary elements from home page
5. Landing page
    a. Add a summary in one column. That can be 8x wide
    b. 4 visuliazation on the side: need to use grid system. it will be on a second column. 4x wide. These will need links to go to their corresponding plot page.
    c. the above needs to have its own container/row with 2 columns and 2 rows
6. Create the Plots each of them. Adding an image to each of them

7. Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
copy the template that's in the land page for the second column into each page, and edit the summary and the image to they show the corresponding one.


8. A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens. This is the second column from the landing page.




9. A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint

The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here
